pia.py and via.py can be run from themselves with the requested inputs as per the assignment. 
Furthermore, we added two additional features:
	Modifiable grid sizes (Not just 4x4 but any two numbers)
	Printable values while it iterates (So you can see the values in a rough grid formation while it runs)
